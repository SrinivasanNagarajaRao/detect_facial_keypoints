# Facial Keypoint Detection and Real-time Filtering

## Introduction

Build an end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system using computer vision techniques and deep learning. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. The system can take in any image or video containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints, as shown below.

The system can hide the identity of individuals on an image or video

It can also do filtering on an image or video and put sunglasses above the eyes.

## Keras and PyTorch Implementation

The project is implemented in both Keras and PyTorch. Detailed instructions (setup, data, etc.) and code for each framework are available in the [keras](https://github.com/ntrang086/detect_facial_keypoints/tree/master/keras) and [pytorch](https://github.com/ntrang086/detect_facial_keypoints/tree/master/pytorch) folders.
